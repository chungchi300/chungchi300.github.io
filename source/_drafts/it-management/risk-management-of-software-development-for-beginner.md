## Risk Identification

You should hold a **meeting** to find out the risks.

  * No judgement-Every discovery is important(even the probability of risk is extremely low)

  * It is a good question.
  * It is a good concern.

## Risk assessment

When you have a list of risk.SA and PM should sort and characteristic the risk.

1.  Type

* Probability
* Measurement tool
* What sign/identifier we can see when it happen

## Risk reduction process design and implementation.

* **Reduction**

  1.  Sample target: Software deployment
  2.  Process: Soft-launch - Avoid marketing cost for a software that have no thorough test.

* **Retention**

  1.  Sample target: Critical system component
  2.  Process: Develop the critical system component by internal development team and increase it priority in schedule.

* **Sharing(transfer)**

  1.  Sample target: Server availability
  2.  Process: Put it on cloud(AWS)

* **Avoidance**

  1.  Sample target: Non critical system component
  2.  Process: Delay development or low priority of non Critical component&feature
