## Speak with purpose
**Write done the information on paper you want to deliver before speaking**.It help you get prepared and enter the speaking mode.

### Example 1:

Purpose:
There is a bug for search API on query field of shopping cart

Extra information to deliver information:

query "nike" return product of "Addidas" and "Nike"

## Triangle principle
**Keep information number below 3.**

The efficient of deliver information is greatly reduced when information number is bigger then 3 due to human focus ability.

## Fact and action first,reason come last

When the information is about telling some fact/action,**express the fact/action first and then follow the reason**.Because people will be more focus at first and the reason make the fact/action more rational

## Without filler words
**Don't speak with filler words like (this,there,like,aa),just keep silent when you are thinking during speaking** .

It greatly reduce noise in communication process and make you looks very smart.

## Ask listener to repeat
**Ask listener to repeat what you said can let you know the percentage that listener accept your information** . And reverse you can apply the same skill to let them know.

## Supplement

Why we not good at,just a practice and switching the mind.

Those sales also sucks at calculation & data analysis,the same principle
