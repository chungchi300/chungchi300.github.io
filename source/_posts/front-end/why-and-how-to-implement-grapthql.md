Critical problem **Over-fetching & Too many round trip of api network layer**

- [Why GraphQL is the future â€“ Apollo GraphQL](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/why-graphql-is-the-future-3bec28193807)

# Relation

## Basic Model

### Grapthql Model

Rest: Entities based api  
GrapthQl: Tree based api

#### Server

- API is a tree(Grapth).
- Each node correspond to a field and it's argument.

#### Client(Query)

- Our query is a tree-like query language which describe the data it's want based on server GrapthQL API

### Implementation

#### Schema - Describe the tree(Server Side)

The syntax is TypeScript like but looser

```javascript
  input bookFilter {
      id: ID
      title: String
      author: String
      isbn: String
      url: String
  }

  // The Actual GraphQL Tree
  type Query {
    # arguments filter for filter is just an convention
    allBook(filter: bookFilter): [Book!]!
  }

  type Mutation {
    createBook(title: String!, author: String!): Book
  }
```

#### Query - Usage of tree(Client Side)

Define fields and field parameter
Query name is optional, won't send to server

```javascript
query {
  allBooks {
    author,
    title
  }
}
query{
  allBooks(filter:{
    id:17
  }) {
    isbn
  }
}
```

## GrapthQL Scope and testing online

[By compare and contrast the rest api on github](https://developer.github.com/v4/guides/migrating-from-rest/)
[Query](https://graphql.org/learn/queries)
[Pagination](https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/)
[Automatic Aggregation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34321688/can-graphql-return-aggregate-counts)

## Server Implementation

[Simplest](https://github.com/hemanth/graphql-demo)

### Resolve Helper(Create 80% of your resolver)

[graphql + sequelize(an orm) ](https://github.com/mickhansen/graphql-sequelize)
[Grapthql + PostgreSQL](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile)

P.S

- GraphQL's strength is that it gives the frontend more power in determining what data specifically is returned. **Some of what you write in GraphQL will be the same as what you would write for a REST API**.

## Client implementation

[Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
[Learn Relay](https://www.learnrelay.org/)

P.S

- Grapth QL client are mostly sacrificing the predictable state change for simply api usage,I think they don't match the product requirement(for complex front end application,**predictable state change** is very important). I prefer using **redux-api-middleware** to call the **grapthql api**

# Execution

- Develop the **query design** for application
- **Implement** the grapthql api
- Make front end application to use grapthql api

# Verify improvement

- For grapthql api,define unit test for grapthql api
- End to End test for front end application that utilize grapthql api
