# Question

## Why we choose **graphql** api to solve our problem?

- [Why GraphQL is the future â€“ Apollo GraphQL](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/why-graphql-is-the-future-3bec28193807)

In summary,we have **critical** problem

- Over-fetching
- Too many round trip

on api network layer

We also want to solve problems like

- Versioning
- API Transparency

# Relation

GraphQL documentation have show the ability

- Ability to avoid over fetching of field
- Ability to describe nested api
- Ability of versioning
- API transparency is very high

# Execution

Start to use graphql in a mini project that have our existing problem
