</div>
</div>

1.For high end graphics programming or CAD work
You should negotiate with your boss about to get best computer.

2.For standard business software programming
For example,you write it using android studio,eclipse and visual studio.
You should negotiate with your boss to get mid-range computer.

Mid range machine should have:
CPU:2 cores min, 4 cores good anymore at this stage is overkill.
Memory:8GB is min and anymore is nice to have.
Hardisk:SSD(128GB) is min and anymore is nice to have.
Monitor:2 x 19 monitors is a minimum.

3.No programmer should use low end machines.

<div class="minipic-title">Timing</div><br />
<div class="minipic-content">Pick a timing that your manager need to decide quickly</div>
</div>
</div>

1.  You should raise your requirement before a project start or in your first work day.Because your manager have a bigger **time-constraint** in that moment.
2.  You should make it clear you won't start your work or you productivity will be very low until you have proper device by email.

Please remind that your attitude should be **nice** and you do this for the **good of your manager and the company**.

<div class="minipic-content">Always prepare enough option for bargaining</div>
</div>
</div>

You should at least have two computer configuration( **max to min** )( **keep it secret!** ) that can help you to get the job done.
You should works for the **max** computer configuration but it is okay to accept any deals that above **min** computer configuration.
If your manager provide any option that is lower the **min** computer configuration.Just told them that is below your minimal expectation and walk away.Don't make it **personal**.

supply and demand picture

## Convince your manager that many company are providing good computer to programmer

It is hard to convince your manager why they should do this by data.Because they are not expert on this thing,they normally just follow what other manager does.
You need to state **many company** doing so because

1.It is part of the [Joel Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html)(a well known test for determining how attractive as company are to programmer).
2.It is proven by expert [Jeff Atwood](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-programmers-bill-of-rights/).

If your company fails to do so,the company has little chance to succeed due to lack of programmer.
Because programmer will generally work for company providing those thing.

## Give the motivation to your manager

Manager mainly focus on **outcome**.
It means you need to explain what you can improve on your outcome if there is a better computer.
For example,
1.The schedule can be shorten by 20%.Because the compilation time is shorten by xx%.
2.The programmer will looks more concentrated to their job.Because they has much less possibility switch to **youtube** for killing time during wait for the compilation,automatic test execution and program deployment.
3.There will be less turnover rate because programmer are much happier with good tool.
