## Better presentation of working product

### Clarify the presentation purpose

In the beginning ,tell the user the purpose of this presentation.The purpose include showing the current progress to user and collect user feedback.

### Remember the behavior of working product

Before presentation,scrum master should know every behavior of the working product.For example,he must know what will happen if he press specific button.
After knowing the behaviours,he can prepare a group behavior flow of working product.

### Remember the word you going to say

Before presentation,scrum master should know every word he is going to said between the behavior flow of working product.The word are the tools to capture user attention and explain what user feel(never explain the detail implementation)

After remember the behavior and word to said.The scrum master will get the presentation flow.He should rehearsal presentation flow at least two times.Moreover,he should record one of them by video in case of failure when presentation.

### Sound Practicing

In additional to the content,it is very important about the speaking voice of the presentation.
The speed should be slow and stable.And I suggest you imitate [obama interview](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=obama+interview)

## Feedback from the client

### QA

Prepare a series of QA session after each section of presentation to collect user requirement.
Prepare a final QA session of presentation.

During the presentation,record every customer requirement and opinion.

## Advice when some function of working product fail.

1.  Show previous record video
2.  Admit that is some problem,you will present it next time.
