# What is find market/company need in real life?

For example,here is a startup CEO I have talked before.His company has a very successful product.He don't specific mentioned his thinking process,but I notice his IT team and development cycle.

# High frequency and reliable upgrade of product

Because his product has many customer and his product need rapid changes to catch up the market change.His team **focus** on the continuous integration and continuous delivery(CICD).It allows his product can delivery feature update **every day/hour**.The delivery can **rollback(it mean switch to previous version)** immediately when things can wrong.

# Long life cycle product and rapid development

Because his product has very long life cycle and need to develop fast according to market change.His team **focus** on **code quality** and **code standard**
