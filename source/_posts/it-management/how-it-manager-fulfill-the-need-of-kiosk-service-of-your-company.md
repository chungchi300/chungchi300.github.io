  <div class="minipic-content">Your client will never not tell you to need the kiosk-service to satisfied their need.It is up to IT-manager to discover it</div>

</div>

## Requirement and fact

First of all you need to collect requirement and facts.

In Jeff case,he knows that

Requirements:

1.  Client always want to which stores sell product they want and their locations. They don't want to walk and see every store to find what they are selling.

Facts:

1.  Client speak different language.Some of them speak Mandarin,some of them speak Cantonese and some of them speak English.
2.  Client are normal young(around 25-55).They knows technology really much and own a smart phone.

## Analysis the requirement

For 1\. Requirement,it can be a kiosk or staff from customer center to answer the client question. However,Jeff choose kiosk because

1.  Hiring staff that speak Mandarin,Cantonese and English are too expensive.However kiosk can display multi-language digital information.
2.  The Kiosk can display the image and the map of the store.However staff can only tell them by words.

Now Jeff want kiosk which displayed the stores of the shopping mall.But what he needs to know before he pick his kiosk-service-provider?

# How to pick kiosk service provider

## Do a research about the famous local kiosk service provider

You should make a list comparing the local kiosk service provider include but not limited the following.

1.  Whether their software are written by themselves.It is very important because it means whether they can fulfill some custom requirement for your company.
2.  Whether they provide 24-hour support?It will be very troublesome when the kiosk is down but no one can fix it.
3.  Price model.
4.  Security architecture.

## See what your competitor pick

Your competitor can be a good reference to your choice. You should use their kiosk and find the strength and limitations.And ask whether your service provider solves those limitations.

## Find similar software of kiosk

# Detail staff you need to know about how to manage kiosk service

1.  Operating system of Kiosk The OS of kiosk is mainly android and windows.The window is developed by c#(.NET) and android mainly java.You should have software engineer that have related skill to identify the threats of kiosk.

2.  Tell people you have kiosk service We always see not many people use the kiosk because people normally don't know you have a kiosk. You should tell user your have new kiosk and attract user to use the kiosk by marketing campaign(like 10% discount).

3.  Cooperate the kiosk and front-line employee We always see the front-line employee thinks about the kiosk is their enemy so they don't really suggest customer to use it but it is not necessary to be that way. You should make them thing kiosk is just another tool to them.They should make good use of it.
