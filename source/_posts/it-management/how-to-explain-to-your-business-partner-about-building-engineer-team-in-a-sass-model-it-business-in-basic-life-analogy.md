# Introduction
I have been asked by my partner and client about how to build an engineer team and how the good engineer team interact with their product. I normally send them this [restaurant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfMZfxgbuCw) and than using it as an analogy.The **food** is the **IT service/information** that the customer eventually get and the **restaurant** is the company. We will focus mainly 6 roles in the analogy.

1. Frontend developer
2. UI/UX designer
3. Backend developer
4. Principle engineer
5. Product manager
6. Project manager


#  Software is like a food in robotic restaurant despite food is created by robot by the people(maker) are the key component.

As you can see that it is mainly divide into 2 part

## Salad ordering machine

* The **front end developer(Web,Mobile)** is the guy build the salad ordering machine.
* The **graphical designer** design the graphical material you see on the salad ordering machine.  

## Salad Robot Machine

* The **backend developer(Java,Php,Nodejs)** is the guy build the salad robot machine.


## The people that support/behind maker
* The engineer lead decide the **whole architecture** that how salad ordering machine and salad robot machine works with each other. They also solve the **critical problem** in the machine building process. 
* The product manager **predict and decide** what kind of food that customer need and cooperate with entire team. 
* The project manager monitor and cooperate resource in order the to **hit specific target** for the restaurant to run smooth 

# Summary
The pretty of software is scalable, once you build the **machines**, you can serve **huge amount** of **customer** at **extremely stable quality**  and each **customer** can enjoy **extreme low price and high quanlity** salad **anytime** and that's the way that **how we server the world!**
