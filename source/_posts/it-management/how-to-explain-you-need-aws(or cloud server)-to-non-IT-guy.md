# Metaphor

{% asset_img cover.jpg %}

1. Web application(software) is a Movie
2. Server is cinema

# Basic

Your web application is like a movie.It needs to **be playing in a cinema(Server)** to let **your customer to watch it**.Traditionally,it is played in **private cinema(Private server)** which is **maintained by ourself**.However,there is more and more **public cinema(cloud server)** that allow us to played our movie(web application) **without maintain our private cinema**.

# What is the advantage of cloud server?

- Cost saving(don't need the money(hardware+human) to maintain your own private cinema(private server),just pay for the service)
- Reliability(e.g AWS has 24hour on-called IT team,and proven record to be reliable to been used by many enterprise customer)
- Manageability.You have higher management efficiency to server.(E.g If you want a private server,it need to purchase hardware,installation,network configuration,but if you have public server,it can be done by clicking few buttons on their website)
- Strategic Edge.You can cancel or purchase your **public server** anytime.

# What is the disadvantage of cloud server?

- Restriction.To ensure security,a little bit restriction will be set to your web application.It is just like the movie played in **specific public cinema** will need **specific blu ray format**.
- Security.Although cloud service provider like AWS has the best security standards and industry certifications,the cloud service provider still have the access to your business data.Therefore,**banking and health industry** still has their concern to **public cloud** due to their regulation law.
