## Before Reading

Although we knows the [adv the offshore development](http://www.umangsoftware.com/Advatanges_Outsourcing_software_development_india.htm),
but we also know the [production rate can be lower significantly](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/offshore-development-reduces-cost-decreases-production-cycle/) if the offshore development goes wrong,so you gonna learn how to manage offshore development after reading this article.

1.  What you can learn after reading this article?

* Help you determine whether you need offshore development center/worker
* You will know how to manage a offshore development center for you company

2.  How much time you will use for reading this article?
    30 minutes

## Real life situation

Jeff is a technical manager of a Hong Kong IT company.
He has too many project to work on recently and he wonder whether some of them can be developed by offshore employees.

## Things you need to think about before making a project to be developed by offshore team.

<div class="minipic-container">
<img class="minipic" src="http://jeff-chung.com/blog_accessary/writing_common_accessary/decision.jpg" />
<div class="minitext-container">
<div class="minipic-title">Decision</div><br />
<div class="minipic-content">Overhead of offshore development for every project exists,all you need to do is find those low overhead project and reduce the overhead as much as possible</div>
</div>
</div>

The low overhead project has some properties.

1.  A open schedule
    If the project schedule is very tight,you need to check the status of every task in every day which make the communication cost is very high.
2.  Challenging project
    If the project is very technically challenging which requires engineers to communicate and exchange opinions frequently.The engineers usually not tend to communicate when the communicate cost is high which will cost communication failure.
3.  Long term project
    Because the project usually involves knowledge transfer between old and new engineer frequently so it is very important that they have low communication cost.
4.  International project
    If the project is very specific for local user,you may need many time to correct some problem that caused by cultural difference.

So the Jeff select the a international travel spot website(which is less local and less urgent) and app to be developed by the offshore team.But what can he do next to reduce the overhead and manage this project successfully?

## Requirement and schedule by pivotal tracker

Pivotal tracker is a **agile development tools**.
Adv:

1.  Every one in the team(local and remote) know who is responsible for specific task and the state of different task at any time.
2.  Bug tracking.
3.  You can also set a release so that everyone knows whether a release is accepted.
4.  Efficient cost analysis and development speed analysis tool.

## Testing document on test lodge

Test lodge is a **testing management tools** which has a good integration with pivotal tracker.
For the requirement that is complicated,it is good to record them in a test case so that the offshore developer can run through the test case before you check it which can reduce many communication cost.

## Deployment on hockey app

Hockey app is a **internal deployment tool** which allows you to deploy ios and android app to every one in you team.
Adv:

1.  Multiple version coexistence
2.  Email notification after deployed
3.  Easy integration(6 hours)

## Regular meeting on every week

I have suggest very good tools(all of them are very cheap and have a free trial version) but I believe that must be some problems that is not included so that I suggest a regular meeting per week for communication for the team communicate special issue.

## Project is done

The international travel spot website and app has been developed successfully.His boss is very happy about the cost reduction and the product.
And hopefully Jeff get promoted quickly XD.
