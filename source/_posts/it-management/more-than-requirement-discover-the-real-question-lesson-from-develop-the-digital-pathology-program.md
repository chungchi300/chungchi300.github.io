# Before Reading

1.  What you can learn after reading this article?

* Help you discover extra front-end requirement that is comprehensive to define user flow in front end with real example

2.  How much time you will use for reading this article?

25 minutes

# Requirement is not enough

Requirement is just functions(functional or non-functional) that client they think you can provide to solve their problem.

The problem of requirement

* Asked and raised by client only who has limited knowledge on IT domain or other.
* Client may well have limited resource(e.g Time) to think about requirement,they may very possibility to reference other application.
* Not comprehensive .

# Main real question is how to solve the client problem,instead of complete the user requirement specifications.

E.g 1
The 60 s solve,hgiht

E.g 2

specifications

Communication over requirement is good .but too abstract,we need more.
