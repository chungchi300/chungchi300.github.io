I am an `IT Specialist` in an Hong Kong Auction House and recently develop a `real time application in 4 month.` During this development, I have learned some valuable lesson as an `full-stack developer there`

# The fullstack developer can locate the bottle neck of the application quickly

I remember I have found feedback that application is slow. I resolve the problem in 2 day which normally takes 2 weeks for 1 backend and 1 frontend developer works together.

The story of that problem solving:

1. Discover some Backend API is slow and fix it.
2. Discover the server is slow when large data set and upgrade the server
3. Discover the rendering of data is slow(the ui is hanging) and rewrite the front end application rendering logic.

# The fullstack developer can design and define maintainable and secure real time communication model and API

The challenging staff of designing real time auction application is mainly about make it `fast` and `secure`. I think knowledge as fullstack developer help me select the `REST` api in `write` operation and `websocket` as `read/notification` mechanism contribute a lot to the application maintainability ,performance and security.

# The fullstack developer can do the estimation more accurately

As fullstack developer I can realize difficulty of each application that I wouldn't make big wrong estimation to the whole application. I wouldn't looks at google search and say it takes 2 week to do it(like 1 week for frontend and 1 week for backend).
