# To my self
the 75th of full-stack developer is 750,000. (57692 per month for 13 month)

The 75th means
1. More experience than typical (checked,React & Redux Master, SASS , China Experience)
2. Strong skillset; may include specialised certification(going to get my aws/ali certification, creating my own course)
3. Fairly complex role(checked)(manage two developer & CTO in China)
