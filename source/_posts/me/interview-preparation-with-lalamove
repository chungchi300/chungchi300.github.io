Lalamove 而家唔抽司機佣
Gogo抽10-13%
理論上做Lalamove 司機條氣順d
冇咁閪臉
不過gogo太出名，個個都用
個個司機焗住做



但call 4van d柯打少得可憐
而家有running van 係903賣緊廣告
希望做得起:-( 
Gogo真係吸血鬼
呢排出埋d政府包鐘$85/hr 都夠膽死#kill#


- GOGOVAN在本港的市佔率達80%，對手包括前稱EasyVan的Lalamove、CALL4VAN及順豐速運旗下的順PHONE車



GOGOVAN介面操作的確係CallVan App當中最出色。搜尋地點設定路線方便，改動路線要求便會自動更新價錢，唔需要不斷去下一版比較價錢。使用APP唔需要登記帳戶！！



在司機黎講,邊個台多單就用邊個,對客人黎講邊個快到邊個平邊個有禮貌就用邊個,但好多司機都同時擁有兩三個台一齊做


How to beat the network effect?How can I play an role in it?

down the best in terms of speed and pricing. Gogovan is really monopolized by a group of vans which all they do is sit there and accept every orders that comes thru. Gogo forced me to share rides a few times and didnt even let me know.
