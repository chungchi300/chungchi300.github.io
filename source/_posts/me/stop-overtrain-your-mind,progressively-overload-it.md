# Things that happen recently.

Recently I am improving my life via 3 things

1. Improve my algorithm and technical skill on https://github.com/chungchi300/headfirst-js-for-leetcode and https://frontendmasters.com/
2. Start my talking and sales class.
3. Start my side project that is about reservation and discount.

# Things I observe

In first few days, I am super motivated to do them using 9 pomodoro(I usually have 15 pomodoro everyday) and I find that I lost my motivation quickly.

And I feel anxiety and self doubts that

1.  What if it fails or not working? It means that I lost many time and effort.
2.  What if there is a better way to improve my life?

# Things I thought

1. You should **communicate and negotiating** with yourself(just like how we train our body) instead of self-blame like. "you are a piece of shit or loser that has no motivation"
2. I think the problem is the **size of the changes and effort** and the solution is **progressively overload it**. I mean your totally can **start it every 2 pomodoro(which cause only 50 minutes) per day** and sticks to it **every single day**. The Advantage is
   1. Greatly reduce the **pressure and self blame**. Everyone can bear the lost of 50 minutes
   2. balance your life so that less stress from life

# Things I observe when I make the changes

1. Less self blame.
2. The improvements makes me want to increase the time of work every day like growth to 4 pomodoro as belows
   1. I get 83 marks in technical interview in amazon.
   2. Know more talking model and understand my work in the business side of my boss.
   3. My side project start to able support my family business and greatly improve my daily work.
