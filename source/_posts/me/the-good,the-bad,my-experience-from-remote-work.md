(Freedom for reaching my natural best!)

# How I get this remote work

I get my current job as **IT Specialist in an auction house**  in last year that the headhunt find me at linkedin. I have the interview with the **operation director** who allows me to work from home 1-2 days per week and work from different countries is common practice in auction business, then I am in. Now due to tight development schedule, I will work 3-4 days per week.

# The Good

1. Really save me a lot of time and energy in the traffic. From me to go to and come back office normally takes me 3 hours.
2. Since I have more time to work and less interruption, I become more productive. I develop two big **product(1. real-time bidding and video streaming for O2O online/offline auction platform,2. internal price estimation program**, maintain our internal warehouse evaluation tool.
3. For the critical and official events **(Like Auction,Pre-Auction events)** that need many communication, I also doing well by supporting our auction house to reach 65 million sales last year.
4. I generally feel much more freedom and happiness because all I need to keep online during our work hour. I normally work longer during my home office day like 9:00am-9:00pm but in my official work day I work like 10:00pm-6:00pm and that is it. 
5. You can do **funny thing** during the rest time of work that you can never do in work. I will do some dips, pull up on my gymnastic ring or a little nap to keep my energy doing the work. 

# The Bad
1. You need to spend some time/money to setup your home office, now I have two `27` monitors at my home, a powerful Macbook and comfortable chair here. If you live in China and work globally, a shadowsock software is a must.
2. Despite there is no problem in task that requires official communication, you normally missed some things that are happening in the office. You may find someone has leave their job or someone just enter the company.
3. If your manager are new to this remote work thing, they may not understand the value of your work in home, but it is solvable by some boss that **really understand what they doing**
